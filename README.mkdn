[Yancy](https://metacpan.org/pod/Yancy) is a simple content management system (CMS) for administering
content in a database. Yancy accepts a configuration file that describes
the data in the database and builds a website that lists all of the
available data and allows a user to edit data, delete data, and add new
data.

Yancy uses [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org) to define the data in
the database. The schema is added to an [OpenAPI
specification](http://openapis.org) which creates a [REST
API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) for
your data.

Yancy can be run in a standalone mode (which can be placed behind
a proxy), or can be embedded as a plugin into any application that uses
the [Mojolicious](https://metacpan.org/pod/Mojolicious) web framework.

Yancy can manage data in multiple databases using different backends
([Yancy::Backend](https://metacpan.org/pod/Yancy::Backend) modules). Backends exist for [Postgres via
Mojo::Pg](https://metacpan.org/pod/Yancy::Backend::Pg), [MySQL via
Mojo::mysql](https://metacpan.org/pod/Yancy::Backend::Mysql), [SQLite via
Mojo::SQLite](https://metacpan.org/pod/Yancy::Backend::SQLite), and [DBIx::Class, a Perl
ORM](https://metacpan.org/pod/Yancy::Backend::DBIC)

## Standalone App

To run Yancy as a standalone application, you must create a `yancy.conf`
configuration file that defines how to connect to your database and what
the data inside looks like. See ["CONFIGURATION"](#configuration) for details.

**NOTE:** Yancy does not have authentication or authorization built-in.
If you want to control which users have access to data, you should use
an HTTP proxy with these features.

Once the application is started, you can navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:3000/admin` to see the Yancy administration app.
Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:3000/` to see the getting started
page.

### Rendering Content

In the standalone app, all paths besides the `/admin` application are
treated as paths to templates. If a specific template path is not found,
Yancy will search for an `index` template in the same directory. If that
template is not found, an error is returned.

The templates are found in the `templates` directory. You can change
the root directory that contains the `templates` directory by setting
the `MOJO_HOME` environment variable.

Template names must end with `.format.ep` where `format` is the
content type (`html` is the default). You can render plain text (`txt`),
JSON (`json`), XML (`xml`), and others.

Database content can be read by using the database helpers that Yancy
provides.

- `yancy->list( $collection )` - Get a list of items
- `yancy->get( $collection, $id )` - Get a single item
- `yancy->set( $collection, $id, $data )` - Update an item
- `yancy->delete( $collection, $id )` - Delete an item
- `yancy->create( $collection, $data )` - Create an item

Some example template code:

    %# Get a list of people
    % my @people = app->yancy->list( 'people' );

    %# Show a list of people names 
    <ul>
        % for my $person ( @people ) {
            <li><%= $person->{name} %></li>
        % }
    </ul>

    %# Get a single person with ID 1
    % my $person = app->yancy->get( 'people', 1 );

    %# Write the person's name to the page
    <p>Hi, my name is <%= $person->{name} %>.</p>

More information about [Mojolicious](https://metacpan.org/pod/Mojolicious) helpers is available at
[Mojolicious::Guides::Rendering](https://metacpan.org/pod/Mojolicious::Guides::Rendering).

### Plugins

In standalone mode, you can configure plugins in the Yancy configuration
file. Plugins can be standard [Mojolicious::Plugins](https://metacpan.org/pod/Mojolicious::Plugins) (with a name
starting with `Mojolicious::Plugin`, or they can be specifically for
Yancy (by extending [Mojolicious::Plugin](https://metacpan.org/pod/Mojolicious::Plugin) and having a name starting
with `Yancy::Plugin`).

Plugins are configured as an array of arrays under the \`plugins\` key.
Each inner array should have the plugin's name and any arguments the
plugin requires, like so:

    {
        plugins => [
            [ 'PodRenderer' ],
            [ CGI => [ "/cgi-bin/script" => "/path/to/cgi/script.pl" ] ],
        ],
    }

## Mojolicious Plugin

For information on how to use Yancy as a Mojolicious plugin, see
[Mojolicious::Plugin::Yancy](https://metacpan.org/pod/Mojolicious::Plugin::Yancy).

## REST API

This application creates a REST API using the standard
[OpenAPI](http://openapis.org) API specification. The API spec document
is located at `/api` in the standalone app, and `/yancy/api` in the
Mojolicious plugin.

# CONFIGURATION

The Yancy configuration file is a Perl data structure. The individual
parts are described below. An example configuration file looks like:

    {
        backend => 'pg://user@example.com/mydb',
        collections => {
            people => {
                type => 'object',
                properties => {
                    id => {
                        type => 'integer',
                        readOnly => 1,
                    },
                    name => { type => 'string' },
                    email => { type => 'string' },
                },
            },
        },
    }

## Database Backend

The `backend` URL defines what database to use and how to connect to
it. Each backend has its own format of URL, and some examples are shown
below. See your backend's documentation for more information.

- [Postgres backend](https://metacpan.org/pod/Yancy::Backend::Pg)

        backend => 'pg://user@example.com/mydb',

- [MySQL backend](https://metacpan.org/pod/Yancy::Backend::Mysql)

        backend => 'mysql://user@localhost/mydb',

- [SQLite backend](https://metacpan.org/pod/Yancy::Backend::SQLite)

        backend => 'sqlite:filename.db',

- [DBIx::Class backend](https://metacpan.org/pod/Yancy::Backend::Dbic)

        backend => 'dbic://My::Schema/dbi:SQLite:file.db',

## Data Collections

The `collections` data structure defines what data is in the database.
Each key in this structure refers to the name of a collection, and the
value describe the fields for items inside the collection.

Each backend may define a collection differently. For a relational
database like Postgres or MySQL, a collection is a table, and the fields
are columns. For an ORM like DBIx::Class, the collections are ResultSet
objects. For a document store like MongoDB, the collections are
collections. See your backend's documentation for more information.

Collections are configured using [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org).
The JSON Schema defines what fields (properties) an item has, and what
type of data those field have. The JSON Schema also can define
constraints like required fields or validate strings with regular
expressions. The schema can also contain metadata like a `title`,
`description`, and even an `example` value. For more information on
what can be defined, see [the docs on JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org).

For a collection named `people` that has 3 fields (an integer `id` and
two strings, `name` and `email`), a minimal JSON schema will look like
this:

    collections => {
        people => {
            properties => {
                id => {
                    type => 'integer',
                    readOnly => 1,
                },
                name => {
                    type => 'string',
                },
                email => {
                    type => 'string',
                },
            },
        },
    },

### Generated Forms

Yancy generates input elements based on the `type`, and `format` of
the object's properties.

- `type => "boolean"` - A Yes/No field
- `type => "integer"` - A number field (`<input type="number" >`)
- `type => "number"` - A number field (`<input type="number" >`)
- `type => "string", format => "date"` - A date field (`<input type="date">`)
- `type => "string", format => "date-time"` - A date/time field (`<input type="datetime-local">`)
- `type => "string", format => "email"` - A e-mail address (`<input type="email">`)
- `type => "string", format => "url"` - A URL input (`<input type="url">`)
- `type => "string", format => "tel"` - A telephone number (`<input type="tel">`)

Fields with an `enum` property will be translated to `<select>`
elements.

Other schema attributes will be translated as necessary to the HTML
input fields:

- `title` will be used to label the input field
- `readOnly`
- `pattern`
- `minimum`
- `maximum`
- `minLength`
- `maxLength`

A Markdown editor can be enabled by using `type => "string", format
&#x3d;> "markdown"`.  The Markdown can then be saved as HTML in another
field by adding `x-html-field => $field_name`.

### Required Values

JSON Schema allows marking properties as required using the `required`
property, which must be an array of property names.

    collections => {
        people => {
            required => [ 'name', 'email' ],
            properties => {
                id => {
                    type => 'integer',
                    readOnly => 1,
                },
                name => {
                    type => 'string',
                },
                email => {
                    type => 'string',
                },
            },
        },
    },

Required values will be marked as such in the HTML.

### Example Values

Setting an example value makes it easier to add new data. When a user
tries to add a new item, Yancy will fill in the data from the `example`
key of the collection. This key holds an example object using fake data.
As an example of our `people` collection:

    people => {
        example => {
            name => 'Philip J. Fry',
            email => 'fry@aol.com',
        },
        properties => { ... },
    },

### Extended Collection Configuration

There are some extended fields you can add to your collection definition
to control how it is treated by Yancy.

- x-id-field

    This key sets the name of the collection's ID field to use to uniquely
    identify individual items. By default, Yancy assumes the ID field is
    named `id`. If your collection uses some other identifier (e-mail
    address or username for example), you should set this configuration key.

        people => {
            'x-id-field' => 'email',
            properties => { ... },
        },

- x-list-columns

    This key should be an array of columns to display on the list view, in
    order. This helps put useful information on the list page.

        people => {
            'x-list-columns' => [ 'name', 'email' ],
            properties => { ... },
        },

### Extended Field Configuration

There are some extended fields you can add to a field configuration
to control how it is treated by Yancy.

- x-hidden

    If true, thie field will be hidden from the rich editing form.

- x-filter

    This key is an array of filter names to run on the field when setting or
    creating an item. Filters can allow for hashing passwords, for example.
    Filters are added by plugins or during configuration of
    [Mojolicious::Plugin::Yancy](https://metacpan.org/pod/Mojolicious::Plugin::Yancy). See
    ["yancy.filter.add" in Mojolicious::Plugin::Yancy](https://metacpan.org/pod/Mojolicious::Plugin::Yancy#yancy.filter.add) for how to add a filter.
