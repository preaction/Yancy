    [Added]

    - Added footer with Yancy version and link to Github
    - Added `plugins` configuration to standalone app
    - Added UI feedback after saving/adding items and error messages on
      failure
    - Added `order_by` to backends and API. Now we can sort the results
      we get from the collection.
    - Added Markdown editor for fields containing Markdown (`"format":
      "markdown"`)
    - Added field filters (`x-filter`) to allow for hashing of passwords
    - Added auto-index templates to the standalone app. This allows for
      building a single template for `/<collection>/<id>`.
    - Added search query to list backend method

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed forms not displaying if an `example` was not added to the
      collection
    - Fixed no list columns displaying without `x-list-columns`. Now
      there are some default column names that will show up in the list.
    - Fixed missing documentation for:
        - Yancy::Backend
        - Plugin helpers

0.004     2017-12-05 14:50:02-06:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed DBIx::Class backend test failing without SQL::Translator.
      Now it skips the test without that required module.

    [Docs]

    - Added more docs to the test files to help new developers

0.003     2017-12-05 13:16:44-06:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Raised minimum Mojolicious version to 7.15 (which adds
      Mojo::File). Thanks CPAN Testers!

0.002     2017-12-02 20:46:56-06:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed app trying to save readonly properties. The OpenAPI spec
      prevents this, but that means we get an error and our data isn't
      saved correctly.

    - Fixed invalid spec URL. The spec only worked accidentally, which
      was weird...

    [Added]

    - Added screenshot to documentation
